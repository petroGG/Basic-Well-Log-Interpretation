# Basic-Well-Log-Interpretation
﻿
﻿An exemple of how to make a quick interpretation of well logs using python, matplotlib, pandas and a few pre-defined petrophysical functions. <br>
﻿<p> Check the Jupyter notebook!</p>
﻿Test data is in WA-1.las, which is converted in WA-1.txt with lastotext.py (not an elegant solution for reading las files!)<br>
﻿Logs can be finally exported to csv or excel !
